      <description>The problem at hand It is the 7th day of the 2021 Advent of Code programming challenge! For the second challenge, we are given a dataset of $n$ points $X = (x_1, x_2, &amp;hellip;, x_n) \in \mathbb{Z}^n$. We are then asked to find $$\gamma = \text{argmin}_{x\in\mathbb{R}} \sum_{i=1}^n \text{dist}&#39;(x,\, x_i),$$ or, in other words, the value of $x \in \mathbb{R}$ that minimises the total sum of a distance function from it to all datapoints $$\text{dist}&#39;(x,\, x_i) = 1 + 2 + &amp;hellip; + |x-x_i| = \frac{1}{2}|x-x_i|\left(|x-x_i|+1\right).</description>

      <description>Waiting List [Hard; fb] Hack the Box CTF 2021 [Qualifiers]
 Your mechanical arm needs to be replaced. Unfortunately, Steamshake Inc which is the top mechanical arm transplants has a long waiting list. You have found a SQL injection vulnerability and recovered two tables from their database. Could you take advantage of the information in there to speed things up? Don&amp;rsquo;t forget, you have a date on Monday!
 Proof of concept First, let us translate the given code into something more mathematical in order to try to model it.</description>

      <description>First, a primer The LFSRs (Linear Feedback Shift Registers) represent a family of very low-level, simple to implement, and darn quick ways of generating seemingly random sequences of bits. It is no surprise then that they are often used as PRNGs (pseudo-random number generators).
 In spite of their many aforementioned practical qualities they are, however, definitely not well known for their cryptographic strength.
 But let&amp;rsquo;s take things one at a time.</description>

      <title>Computing discrete logs over GF(2 ^ n) in practice</title>

      <description>Quick how-to # sage K.&amp;lt;x&amp;gt; = GF(2 ** n, impl=&amp;#39;pari_ffelt&amp;#39;) # invoke pari via SageMath&amp;#39;s bindings g = K(x ** 4 + x ** 2 + 1) h = g ** 123 h.log(g) # =&amp;gt; 123 The exact implementation SageMath uses for .log() with pari_ffelt can be found here.
Even for a (relatively) large $n$ this seems to be instantaneous, as opposed to the default implementation which simply hangs.
Other things to note Performing this calculation directly (in PARI/GP), e.</description>
