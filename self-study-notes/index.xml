      <description>First, a primer The LFSRs (Linear Feedback Shift Registers) represent a family of very low-level, simple to implement, and darn quick ways of generating seemingly random sequences of bits. It is no surprise then that they are often used as PRNGs (pseudo-random number generators).
 In spite of their many aforementioned practical qualities they are, however, definitely not well known for their cryptographic strength.
 But let&amp;rsquo;s take things one at a time.</description>
